# Chocobo Breeding Calculator!

Simple calculator. It grabs all the possible pairs of chocobos (no pruning because maximum 25 possible combinations), figures out their scores by adding together each parent's parents' stats, giving 4s an advantage to avoid double 3s being better than 4 1s, sorts the results to get the mathematically best pairing, and neatly outputs it to the bottom showcase.
